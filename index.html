<h2>Lorem Ipsum </h2>
<h5> September 28, 2020 by Mario Munroe</h5>
<img src="loremip.jpg" >
<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 
The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. 
Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. 
Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<h2>Microsoft Edge <h2>
<h5> September 28, 2020 by Mario Munroe </h5>

<p>Microsoft Edge is a cross-platform web browser developed by Microsoft. 
It was first released for Windows 10 and Xbox One in 2015, then for Android and iOS in 2017, and for macOS in 2019, with a preview release for Linux coming in October 2020.</p>

<p>Microsoft Edge is a web browser developed by Microsoft, released in 2015. Microsoft Edge replaced Internet Explorer. Microsoft Edge is a free web browser rebuilt using the open-source Chromium project. 
Owing to the latest upgrade, Edge is now in the league of web browsers that directly compete with Google Chrome. Unlike its predecessor, Edge can be downloaded on multiple devices like Android, iOs, macOS, and all versions of Windows.
The new Edge has a few features that set it apart from Chrome, like better privacy settings. It also uses less of my computer's resources, which Chrome is notorious for hogging. 
Perhaps most importantly, the browser extensions you'd find in Chrome are also available in the new Edge too, making it way more useful.</p>
